## This is the first

So I decided to make a blog, just to log my progression. I was thinking about what to do about my portfolio for so long, I've finally decided that I just needed a quick and easy to use site that both links what I've been working on and also a section for future recruiters or people interested in my work to get a live update and a snippet into my thinking.

So this is a new beginning, and I'm looking forward to what comes next...
